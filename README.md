Measuring Social Control of Urban Areas: A Case Study of Reported Incivilities in Stockholm

The research involved several analyses, including descriptive statistics, trend analysis, seasonal decomposition analysis, and time series forecasting using a seasonal ARIMAX model with exogenous variables (SARIMAX).

For the descriptive statistics, the researchers used basic statistical measures such as means, standard deviations, and ranges to summarize the data. For trend analysis, the researchers used linear regression to estimate the trend line for each event category before and after the pandemic. For seasonal decomposition analysis, the researchers used a multiplicative decomposition approach to decompose each time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components. Finally, for time series forecasting, the researchers used the SARIMAX model to generate forecasts for each event category.
