The research involved several analyses, including descriptive statistics, trend analysis, seasonal decomposition analysis, and time series forecasting using a seasonal ARIMAX model with exogenous variables (SARIMAX).

For trend analysis, the researchers used linear regression to estimate the trend line for each event category before and after the pandemic. For seasonal decomposition analysis, the researchers used a multiplicative decomposition approach to decompose each time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components. And for time series forecasting, the researchers used the SARIMAX model to generate forecasts for each event category.

Lastly, the variation in trends for considered incivilities are analysed using a Poisson spatial/local regression model using spatial autocorrelation (CAR), and Marcov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation using Gamma dispersion method.
